\section{\-Class \-List}
\-Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_affordances}{\-Affordances} \\*\hyperlink{class_affordances}{\-Affordances} localizes grasp affordances and handles in a point cloud. \-It also provides helper methods to filter out points from the point cloud that are outside of the robot's workspace }{\pageref{class_affordances}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classpcl_1_1_curvature_estimation_taubin}{pcl\-::\-Curvature\-Estimation\-Taubin$<$ Point\-In\-T, Point\-Out\-T $>$} \\*\hyperlink{classpcl_1_1_curvature_estimation_taubin}{\-Curvature\-Estimation\-Taubin} estimates the curvature for a set of point neighborhoods in the cloud using \-Taubin \-Quadric \-Fitting. \-This class uses the \-Open\-M\-P standard to permit parallelized feature computation }{\pageref{classpcl_1_1_curvature_estimation_taubin}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_cylindrical_shell}{\-Cylindrical\-Shell} \\*\hyperlink{class_cylindrical_shell}{\-Cylindrical\-Shell} represents a cylindrical shell that consists of two colinear cylinders. \-A shell consists of an inner and an outer cylinder. \-The portion of the object to be grasped must fit inside the inner cylinder, and the radius of that cylinder must be no larger than the maximum hand aperture. \-The gap between the inner and outer cylinder must be free of obstacles and wide enough to be able to contain the robot fingers }{\pageref{class_cylindrical_shell}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_messages}{\-Messages} \\*\hyperlink{class_messages}{\-Messages} creates custom \-R\-O\-S messages to publish the results of the localization. \-The messages that can be created are\-: \-Cylinder\-Array, \-Cylinder, and \-Handle\-List }{\pageref{class_messages}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_visualizer}{\-Visualizer} \\*\hyperlink{class_visualizer}{\-Visualizer} creates \-R\-O\-S messages to visualize the results of the localization in \-R\-Viz. \-The possible objects that can be visualized are\-: neighborhoods, cylindrical shells, and handles }{\pageref{class_visualizer}}{}
