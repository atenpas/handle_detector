1.0.6 (2014-03-25)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#1 <https://github.com/atenpas/handle_detector/issues/1>`_ from cottsay/master
  Fix Fedora build errors
* Move default affordances values into source file
  I really couldn't tell you exactly why this was failing builds on 32-bit Fedora, but in any case this fixes it.
* Build message_lib only after message generation
  On faster machines, the makefile generated by cmake will thread quite a lot, and will attempt to compile messages_lib before the header files have been generated, failing the build.
  This will force make to wait for the message generation to complete.
